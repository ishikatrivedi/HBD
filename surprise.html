    <h2>Bday Wish</h2>
    <p>Lots of love and happiness on your 2nd college bday Aaditry. I started talking to you after the hectic of the
        reviews that were going on in our clubs. Those were the crucial days i guess. The first day talk in-itself was
        so
        comfortable that i cant tell you. You have been special to me till date. We share same behaviour, same attitude
        and same everything accept the most important thing which is the LOVE TOWARDS CHOCOLATES. Hehehe you know what
        why i always remind you for the sharing of your sweets with me though i know that you will give me :)). It is
        because i love to discuss stupids things with you. Haahaha, idk when we will discuss these things in real and
        when i will fight with you for the chocolates :((. Again wishing you lots of love and Many Many Many More Happy
        Returns Of The Day CHUNNU... </p>

    <p>I am waiting for the chocolate. Swiggy krdena. I will send you my address details :)). Enjoy your day and have a
        blast. Hope you will like my work. This is something first i am making for you only. Abhi tk koi b website ni
        banaye h. So, i hope you like it.
    <h3>Happy Birthday.</h3>
